### Hi there 👋 my name is AbedalatifIssa

Full-stack developer 
🚀 Ever since I was a little kid, computers caught my eyes. You could literally do a lot of things on them, and now everything is easy if you have a computer. Well, I did not want this passion to go to waste without turning it into something useful. Therefore, I aspire to be a great software developer soon enough! Though it might not be as easy as it seems, one can try his best to learn and keep trying to destroy any problem that comes in his way!

Skills🛠: Django / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Python / Flask / MySQL / SQLite / Node.js / MongoDB

🔭 I’m currently learning to become a full-stack developer 😏
